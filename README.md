## ⚙️ How to Update the Content (CMS)

The app is designed with a "Headless" architecture. The logic is in `index.html`, but **all content and settings** live in `komorebi-data.js`.

To add new quotes, change checkboxes, or update scoring, you only need to edit one file.

### 1. To Add a New Mental Model or Quote
1. Open `komorebi-data.js`.
2. Scroll to the `library` section.
3. Add your item to the appropriate list:

```javascript
mentalModels: [
    { name: "New Model Name", desc: "Description of how it works." },
    // ... other models
],
